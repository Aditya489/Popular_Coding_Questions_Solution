### command line Program
  Command line argument is a parameter supplied to the program when it is invoked.

### palindrome
  A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, 
  e.g Anna,1221,Noon,Racecar etc

### reverse digit
  given an input number print its reverse as output   
  e.g input-->123    output-->321

### string palindrome
  area of circle, triangle := Area of circle = pi*r*r where pi=3.14
  
### sqrt of prime no without using SQRT fun

### perfect number 
   In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum      of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. 
   e.g 28 is a perfect number divisors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14 which sum upto 28 = (1+2+4,7+14)

### factorial
   In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal    to n. For example, The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.
   e.g 5! = 120 i.e 5x4x3x2x1=120

### fibonnaci series

### swapping 
   swap the input variables  input-->a=10,b=20  -->output a=20,b=10

# armstrong number: 
# An Armstrong number is a number such that the sum  of its digits raised to the third power is equal to the number itself. For           example, 371 is an Armstrong number, since 3^3+7^3+1^3 = 371
    
## given input n print first n elements of the Series of the form 2,6,6,12,12,12,20,20,20,20,30,30,30,30,30....
